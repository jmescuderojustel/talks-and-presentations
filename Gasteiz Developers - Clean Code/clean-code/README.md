# Refactor example

## Description

Small example for refactoring. Take the *Before* project and try to refactor it to get the code that you yourself would call **Clean Code**.

If you need any idea or want to take a second opinion, you can allways go to the *After* project and look how I solved it.

## Share your refactor

Please, let me know how you solved it. Any idea is really appreciated.

## About the sample data

**This is important**

The sample data used in this solution is part of the **free** data that can be downloaded from 
[https://www.briandunning.com/sample-data/](https://www.briandunning.com/sample-data/). 

Run **setup.ps1** files (*Powershell files*) to grab file and place it in the expected place in the project automatically. 

You will have to run each **setup.ps1** that is in each project.
